# The Catastrophe Coefficient 2: The Catastrophe Strikes Back

This repository details an expansion of the work done by the original Catastrophe Coefficient group. The intention is to revamp the project
using data of varying resolutions to reduce the franly ludicrous number of records we had to work with in the first project, while not 
sacrificing much in the way accuracy.

The repo for the original project can be found at https://github.com/Senkichi/The_Catastrophe_Coefficient/. A more detailed write-up for the 
project can be found at www.samuelsenkichi.com/tcc-documentation.html, and the application itself can be found at www.samuelsenkichi.com/tcc.html
